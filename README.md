# Challenges
Getting Fusion360 on Linux...  
I tried every method, trying my hardest to NOT go on Windows, but at the end, I gave up and went on Windows...
# End Result
I feel like later on, I will try and design a better case for it, as the current one is made help with the guide.  
This has actually inspired me to try and make something else down the line.
